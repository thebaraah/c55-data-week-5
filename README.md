# Week 5 Assignment: Containerize and Ship

You have a Python pipeline. Your job is to make it reproducible, containerized, and shippable through CI.

## Project structure

```text
week5-container-assignment/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml          ← Task 6: CI workflow (fill in the TODO steps)
├── src/
│   └── pipeline.py         ← Task 1 & 5: pipeline logic and env-var config
├── tests/
│   └── test_pipeline.py    ← Task 3: provided tests; make them pass
├── Dockerfile              ← Task 4: write a cache-friendly Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt        ← Task 2: pin all dependencies
└── AI_ASSIST.md            ← Task 8: document your LLM usage
```

## Open in Codespaces

> 💻 [Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new/HackYourFuture/data-assignment-week-5)

Docker and the Azure CLI are pre-installed. Before Task 7, sign in with your **HackYourFuture** account (not a personal Azure account), targeting the HackYourFuture tenant:

```bash
az login --use-device-code --tenant 07a14c4e-d88c-42f7-83b3-13af7e57ff3d
```

## Tasks at a glance

These task numbers match the Week 5 assignment chapter in your HackYourFuture Notion curriculum.

> 💡 **Task 7 credentials:** the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON your CI needs in Task 7 is the same for every student in the cohort. Your teacher DMs it to you over **Slack**. Ping your teacher in your cohort channel if you have not received it by the time you reach Task 7.

| Task | What you do |
|---|---|
| 1: Choose a Pipeline | The starter `src/pipeline.py` has three functions with `raise NotImplementedError`. Implement them so the provided tests pass. |
| 2: Define Dependencies | Fill in `requirements.txt` with pinned versions (`package==version`). |
| 3: Write Tests | The starter ships a full test suite in `tests/test_pipeline.py`. Make your Task 1 implementation pass it: `API_KEY=test pytest -q`. |
| 4: Write a Dockerfile | Complete the `Dockerfile` following the TODO comments. |
| 5: Add Configuration | `get_config()` must read `API_KEY` from the environment and raise a clear error if it is missing. |
| 6: Build a CI Workflow | Replace the `echo "TODO"` steps in `ci.yml` with real commands. |
| 7: Push to ACR | Add Azure login + ACR push steps to your workflow; screenshot the result. |
| 8: AI Report | Fill in `AI_ASSIST.md` with your LLM prompt, the suggestion, and what you changed. |

## How to run locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
API_KEY=test pytest -q
```

## How to run in Docker (after completing Task 4)

```bash
docker build -t my-pipeline:1.0 .
docker run --rm -e API_KEY=test my-pipeline:1.0
```

## Submitting

1. Create a branch: `git switch -c week5/your-name`
2. Commit your work.
3. Push and open a Pull Request against `main`.
4. Share the PR URL with your teacher.
